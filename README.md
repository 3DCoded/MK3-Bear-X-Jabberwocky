# MK3-Bear-X-Jabberwocky

Modification of the Prusa MK3S+ Bear X-axis for the [Jabberwocky](https://github.com/kinematicdigit/Jabberwocky) print head

# Introduction

[Jabberwocky](https://github.com/kinematicdigit/Jabberwocky) is a print head designed specifically for toolchangers, which would be perfect for my Prusa MK3S+ Bear with the [3MS](https://3ms.3dcoded.xyz/) MMU on it. However, the Jabberwocky doesn't support the Prusa MK3S+. 

Because space behind the JW is very limited, you can't just create a mount with the existing smooth rods without moving the entire print head far forward and losing a ton of Y-axis print area. Instead, I completely redesigned the X-axis on the Prusa to use a single MGN12H rail, the same that the Voron 2.4/Trident/Switchwire uses. Combined with a custom belt mount, the only part of the JW that was modified was the back carriage, to connect to the belts. The rest of the toolhead is completely unaltered.
